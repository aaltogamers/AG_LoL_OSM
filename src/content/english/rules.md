## Rules

These rules are the official rules of SEUL ry for League of Legends -game. The rules are
used in all tournaments certified by SEUL ry and are maintained by a separate rules group.
Each person participating in the tournament must read and understand the rules below and
behave in an athletic manner during the tournament. Tournament judges ultimately have the
power to decide in all situations of conflict and sanction. Tournament officials reserve all
rights to changes to these rules. If necessary, the tournament judges may suspend the
tournament due to a serious technical problem or other possible sudden event, such as an
illness.

These rules are mainly for tournaments played at a local tournament event. Minor changes
can be made to the rules for online tournaments. The tournament organizer is obliged to
announce the schedules, tournament format and prizes before the tournament start.

Any cheating, including watching the game with the assistance of another person, is
prohibited. If an entrant does not know if any game mechanics are allowed, they should ask
the Referee before the tournament whether or not that mechanic is allowed. Violation of the
rules will result in penalties that are:

The decision made by the tournament judge can be challenged by discussing the matter with
the tournament judge. An appeal against the decision must be made to the Referee as soon
